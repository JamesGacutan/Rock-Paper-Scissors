# The Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors

My first project in The Odin Project curriculum. 
A simple implementation of The Rock Paper Scissors game.

# Description

A Fire Emblem Weapon Triangle based Rock Paper Scissors, I like FE since I was a kid so I decided to try and change RPS with FE's Weapon Triangle which is Swords, Axes and Lances.

The game works just like RPS, 1 weapon beats the others. Swords beats Axes, Axes beats Lances and Lances beats Swords.
